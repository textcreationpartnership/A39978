            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now having thus farre cleared our way in this buſineſſe, we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide to propound ſuch things as we do humbly deſire for the ſetling and ſecuring of our owne and the Kingdomes peace and ſafety, as followeth:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Houſes may be ſpeedily purged of ſuch Members, as for their Delinquency, or for corruptions or abuſe to the State, or undue electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ought not to ſit there; whereof the late election in Cornwall, Wales, and other parts of the Kingdome afford too many examples, to the great prejudice of the peoples freedome, in the ſaid Elections.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That thoſe perſons who have in the late unjuſt and high proceedings againſt the Army, appeared to have the will, the confidence, credit, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, to abuſe the Parliament and the Army, and indanger the Kingdome in the carrying on ſuch things againſt us (while an Army) may be ſome way ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſabled from doing the like or worſe to us (who d sbanded and diſpearſt, and in the condition of private men) or to other the free borne people of England, in the ſame condition with us: And that (for that purpoſe) the ſame perſons may not continue in the ſame power (eſpecially) as our and the Kingdoms Iudges in the Higheſt Truſt, but may be made incapable thereof for future.</p>

               </gap>ed, by diſinabling ſuch men at leaſt from places of Judicature, who deſiring to advantage or ſet up themſelves and their party in a general confuſion, have endeavored to put the Kingdom into a new flame of War, then which nothing is more abhorrent to us.</p>
            <p>But becauſe neither the granting of theſe alone would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſecure our own and the Kingdoms Right, Liberties and Safety, either for the preſent Age or poſterity: Nor would our propoſal of this ſingly be free from the ſcandal and appearance of Faction or Deſign onely to weaken one party (under the notion of unjuſt or tyrannical) that we may advance another which may be imagined more our own) We therefore Declare, That indeed we cannot but wiſh that ſuch men, and ſuch onely might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the great power and truſt of the Commonwealth, as are approved at leaſt for Moral Righteouſneſs; and of ſuch, we cannot but in our wiſhes prefer thoſe that appear acted thereunto by a principle of Conſcience and Religion in them: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we do and ever ſhall bleſs God for thoſe many ſuch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, who through his providence have been choſen into this Parliament, and to ſuch mens endeavors under God) we cannot but attribute that Vindication in part of the peoples Rights and Liberties, and thoſe beginnings of a juſt Reformation, which the firſt proceedings of this Parliament appeared to have driven at and tended to, though of late obſtructed, or rather diverted to other ends and intereſts, by the prevailing of other perſons of other principles and conditions.</p>
            <p>But yet we are ſo far from deſigning or complying to have an abſolute or Arbitrary power fixt or ſetled for continuance, in any perſons whatſoever, as that (if we might be ſure to obtain it) we cannot wiſh to have it ſo in the perſons of any whom we could moſt confide in, or who ſhould appear moſt of our own
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57841:7"/>
Opinions or Principles, or whom we might have perſonal aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of, or intereſt in; but we do and ſhall much rather wiſh, That the Authority of this Kingdom in Parliaments rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted (that is) freely, equally and ſucceſſively choſen, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its original intention, may ever ſtand and have its courſe. And therefore we ſhall apply our deſires chiefly to ſuch things, as (by having Parliaments ſetled in ſuch a right conſtitution) may give moſt hopes of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs to flow down equally to all in that its ancient channel, without any Overtures tending either to overthrow that foundation of Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in this Kingdom, or to ingroſs that power for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity into the hands of any particular perſons or party whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and for that purpoſe, though as we have found it doubted by many men (minding ſincerely the publique good, but not weighing ſo fully all conſequences of things) it may, and is not unlike to prove, That upon the ending of this Parliament, and the Election of new, the conſtitution of ſucceeding Parliaments (as to the perſons elected) may prove for the worſe many ways; yet ſince neither in the preſent purging of this Parliament, nor in the Election of new, we cannot promiſe to our ſelves or to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom an aſſurance of Juſtice, or other poſitive good, from the hands of men, but thoſe who for preſent appear moſt righteous and moſt for common good (having an unlimited power fixed in them during life or pleaſure) in time may become corrupt, or ſettle into parties or Factions; or on the other ſide, in the caſe of new Elections, thoſe that ſhould ſo ſucceed may prove as bad or worſe then the former: We therefore humbly conceive, That (of two inconveniences the leſs being to be choſen) the main things to be intended in this caſe (and beyond which humane providence cannot reach, as to any aſſurance of poſitive good) ſeems to be this; <hi>viz.</hi> To provide, that however unjuſt or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the perſons of Parliament-men in preſent or future may prove, or whatever ill they may do to particular parties, or to the whole in particular things, during their reſpective terms or periods, yet they ſhall not have the temptation or advantage of an unlimited power fixt in them during their own pleaſures, whereby to perpetuate Injuſtice and Oppreſſion upon any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end or remedy, or to advance and uphold any one particular
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57841:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Party, Faction or Intereſt whatſoever, to the oppreſſion or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Community, and the inſlaving of the Kingdom unto all poſterity; but that theſe people may have an equal hope or poſſibility (if they have made an ill choice at one time to amend it in another) and themſelves may be in a capacity to taſte of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection aſwel as Rule, and may ſo be inclined to conſider of other mens caſes, as what may come to be their own. This we ſpeak as in relation to the Houſe of Commons, as being intruſted on the peoples behalf for their intereſt in that great and Supreme power of the Commonwealth, (<hi>viz.</hi> The Legiſlative power, with the power of final Judgement) which being in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo Arbitrary, and in a maner unlimited (unleſs in point of time) is moſt unfit and dangerous, as to the peoples intereſt, to be fixt in the perſons of the ſame men during life or their own pleaſure; neither by the original conſtitution of this State was it or ought it to continue ſo, nor do's it where ever it is and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo, render that State any better then a meer Tyranny, or the people ſubjected to it any better then Vaſſals; but in all States where there is any face of common Freedom, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in this State of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> as is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent both by many Poſitive Laws (and Ancient conſtant Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms) the People have a Right to new and ſucceſſive Elections unto that great and Supreme Truſt, at certain periods of time, which is ſo Eſſential and Fundamental to their Freedom, as it cannot or ought not to be denied them or withheld from them, and without which the Houſe of Commons is of very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the Intereſt of the Commons of <hi>England:</hi> Yet in this we would not be miſunderſtood, in the leaſt to blame thoſe Worthies of both Houſes, whoſe zeal to vindicate the Liberties of this Nation, did procure that Act for continuance of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, whereby it was ſecured from being diſſolved at the Kings pleaſure, as former Parliaments have been, and reduced to ſuch a certainty as might enable them the better to aſſert and vindicate the Liberties of this Nation, immediately before ſo highly invaded, and then alſo ſo much indangered; and theſe we take to be the principal ends and grounds for which in that exigency of time and affairs it was promiſed, and to which we acknowledge it hath happily been made uſe of: But we cannot
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57841:8"/>
think it was by thoſe Worthies intended, or ought to be made uſe of, to the perpetuating of that Supreme Truſt and Power in the perſons of any during their own pleaſures, or to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring of the People from their right of Elections totally new, when thoſe Dangers or Exigencies were paſt, and the Affairs and Safety of the Common-wealth would admit of ſuch a change.</p>
            <p>Having thus cleared our Grounds and Intentions, as we hope, from all ſcruples or miſunderſtandings; in what follows we ſhall proceed further to propoſe, what we humbly deſire for the ſetling and ſecuring of our own and the Kingdoms Rights and Liberties (through the bleſſing of God to Poſterity) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon all the grounds premiſed, we further humbly deſire as followeth:</p>
            <p n="3">3. That ſome determinate period of time may be ſet, for the continuance of this and future Parliaments, beyond which none ſhall continue, and upon which new Writs may of courſe iſſue out, and new Elections ſucceſſively take place, according to the intent of the Bill for Triennial Parliaments.</p>
            <p>And herein we would not be miſunderſtood, to deſire a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or ſudden diſſolution of this Parliament, but onely (as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed before) That ſome certain period may be ſet for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of it, ſo as it may not remain (as now) continuaile for ever, or during the pleaſure of the preſent Members: And we ſhould deſire, That the period to be now ſet for ending this Parliament, may be ſuch as may give ſufficient time for proviſion of what is wanting, and neceſſary to be paſſed in point of Juſt Reformation, and for further ſecuring the Rights, Liberties, and ſetling the Peace of the Kingdom; In order to which we further humbly offer:</p>
            <p n="4">4. That ſecure proviſion may be made for the continuance of future Perliaments, ſo as they may not be adjournable or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable at the Kings pleaſure, or any other ways, then by their own conſent, during their reſpective periods, but at thoſe periods each Parliament to determine of courſe, as before: This we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire may be now provided for (if it may be) ſo as to put it out of all diſpute for future, though we think of right it ought not to have been otherwiſe before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57841:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>And thus a firm foundation being laid in the Authority and Conſtitution of Parliament, for the hopes at leaſt of Common and Equal Right and Freedom to our ſelves, and all the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born People of this Land; We ſhall for our parts freely and cheerfully commit our ſtock or ſhare of Intereſt in this Kingdom into this common Bottom of Parliaments; and though it may (for our particulars) go ill with us in one voyage, yet we ſhall thus hope (if right be with us) to fare better in another: Theſe things we deſire may be provided for by Bill or Ordinance of Parliament, to which the Royal Aſſent may be deſired; and when His Majeſty in theſe things, and what elſe ſhall be propoſed by the Parliament, neceſſary for ſecuring the Rights and Liberties of the People, and for ſetling the Militia and Peace of the Kingdom, ſhall have given his Concurrence, to put them paſt all diſpute; We ſhall then deſire, That the Rights of His Majeſty and His Poſterity may be conſidered of, and ſetled in all things, ſo far as may conſiſt with the Right and Freedom of the Subject, and with the ſecurity of the ſame for future.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We deſire, That the Rights and Freedom of the People to repreſent, by way of humble Petition to the Parliament, their grievances in ſuch things as cannot otherwiſe be remedied, then by Parliament, may be cleared and vindicated: That all ſuch Grievances of the People may be freely received and admitted into conſideration, and put into an equitable and ſpeedy way to be heard, examined and redreſſed (if they appear real) And that in ſuch things for which men have remedy by Law, they may be freely left to the benefit of Law, and the regulated courſe of Juſtice, without interruption or check from the Parliament, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in caſe of things done upon the Exigency of War, or for the ſervice and benefit of the Parliament and Kingdom, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the War, or otherwiſe, in due purſuance and execution of Ordinances or Orders of Parliament.</p>
            <p>More particularly under this Head we cannot but deſire, That all ſuch as are impriſoned for any pretended Miſdemeanor, may be put into a ſpeedy way for a juſt Hearing and Tryal, and ſuch as ſhall appear to have been unjuſtly and unduly impriſoned, may (with their liberties) have ſome reaſonable reparation, according to their ſufferings, and the demerit of their oppreſſors.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57841:9"/>6. That the large Powers given to Committees or Deputy Lieutenants, during the late times of War and Diſtraction, may be ſpeedily taken into conſideration, That ſuch of thoſe Powers as appear not neceſſary to be continued, may be taken away, and ſuch of them as are neceſſary, be put into a regulated way, and left to as little Arbitraryneſs as the nature and neceſſity of the things wherein they are converſant will bear.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We could wiſh that the Kingdom might both be righted, and publikely ſatisfied in point of Accompts for the vaſt ſums that have been levied and paid, as alſo in divers other things wherein the Commonwealth may be conceived to have been wronged or abuſed; But we are loath to preſs any thing that may tend to lengthen out further diſputes or conteſtations, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch as may tend to a ſpeedy and general compoſure and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting of mens mindes in order to Peace: For which purpoſe we further propoſe,</p>
            <p n="8">8. That (publique Juſtice being firſt ſatisfied by ſome few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to Poſterity, out of the worſt of excepted perſons and other Delinquents having paſt their compoſitions) ſome courſe may be taken (by an Act of Oblivion or otherwiſe) whereby the ſeeds of future War or Fewds, either to the preſent age or poſterity may the better be taken away, by eaſing that ſence of preſent, and ſatisfying thoſe fears of future ruine or undoing to perſons or families, which may drive men into any deſperate ways for ſelf-preſervation or remedy; and by taking away the private remembrances and diſtinctions of parties, as far as may ſtand with ſafety to the Rights and Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erties we have hitherto fought for.</p>
            <p>There are beſides theſe, many particular things which we could wiſh to be done, and ſome to be undone, all in order ſtill to the ſame ends of Common Right, Freedom, Peace and Safety: but theſe propoſals aforegoing preſent, being the principal things we bottom and inſiſt upon, we ſhall (as we have ſaid before, for our parts) acquieſce for other particulars to the Wiſdom and Juſtice of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And whereas it hath been ſuggeſted or ſuſpected, That in our late or preſent proceedings, our deſign is to overthrow Presbytery, or hinder the ſetlement thereof, and to have the Independent
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57841:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Government ſet up, we do clearly diſclaim and diſavow any ſuch deſign: we only deſire, That according to the Declaration (promiſing a proviſion for tender Conſciences) there may ſome effectual courſe be taken according to the intent thereof, and that ſuch, who upon conſcientious grounds may differ from the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Forms, may not for that be debarred from the common Rights, Liberties or Benefits belonging equally to all, as men and members of the Commonwealth, while they live ſoberly, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and inoffenſively towards others, and peaceably and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully towards the State.</p>
