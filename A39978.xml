            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>But becauÅ¿e neither the granting of theÅ¿e alone would be Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Å¿ecure our own and the Kingdoms Right, Liberties and Safety, either for the preÅ¿ent Age or poÅ¿terity: Nor would our propoÅ¿al of this Å¿ingly be free from the Å¿candal and appearance of Faction or DeÅ¿ign onely to weaken one party (under the notion of unjuÅ¿t or tyrannical) that we may advance another which may be imagined more our own) We therefore Declare, That indeed we cannot but wiÅ¿h that Å¿uch men, and Å¿uch onely might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the great power and truÅ¿t of the Commonwealth, as are approved at leaÅ¿t for Moral RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s; and of Å¿uch, we cannot but in our wiÅ¿hes prefer thoÅ¿e that appear acted thereunto by a principle of ConÅ¿cience and Religion in them: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we do and ever Å¿hall bleÅ¿s God for thoÅ¿e many Å¿uch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, who through his providence have been choÅ¿en into this Parliament, and to Å¿uch mens endeavors under God) we cannot but attribute that Vindication in part of the peoples Rights and Liberties, and thoÅ¿e beginnings of a juÅ¿t Reformation, which the firÅ¿t proceedings of this Parliament appeared to have driven at and tended to, though of late obÅ¿tructed, or rather diverted to other ends and intereÅ¿ts, by the prevailing of other perÅ¿ons of other principles and conditions.</p>
            <p>But yet we are Å¿o far from deÅ¿igning or complying to have an abÅ¿olute or Arbitrary power fixt or Å¿etled for continuance, in any perÅ¿ons whatÅ¿oever, as that (if we might be Å¿ure to obtain it) we cannot wiÅ¿h to have it Å¿o in the perÅ¿ons of any whom we could moÅ¿t confide in, or who Å¿hould appear moÅ¿t of our own

Opinions or Principles, or whom we might have perÅ¿onal aÅ¿Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of, or intereÅ¿t in; but we do and Å¿hall much rather wiÅ¿h, That the Authority of this Kingdom in Parliaments rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tituted (that is) freely, equally and Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively choÅ¿en, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its original intention, may ever Å¿tand and have its courÅ¿e. And therefore we Å¿hall apply our deÅ¿ires chiefly to Å¿uch things, as (by having Parliaments Å¿etled in Å¿uch a right conÅ¿titution) may give moÅ¿t hopes of JuÅ¿tice and RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s to flow down equally to all in that its ancient channel, without any Overtures tending either to overthrow that foundation of Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in this Kingdom, or to ingroÅ¿s that power for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity into the hands of any particular perÅ¿ons or party whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and for that purpoÅ¿e, though as we have found it doubted by many men (minding Å¿incerely the publique good, but not weighing Å¿o fully all conÅ¿equences of things) it may, and is not unlike to prove, That upon the ending of this Parliament, and the Election of new, the conÅ¿titution of Å¿ucceeding Parliaments (as to the perÅ¿ons elected) may prove for the worÅ¿e many ways; yet Å¿ince neither in the preÅ¿ent purging of this Parliament, nor in the Election of new, we cannot promiÅ¿e to our Å¿elves or to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom an aÅ¿Å¿urance of JuÅ¿tice, or other poÅ¿itive good, from the hands of men, but thoÅ¿e who for preÅ¿ent appear moÅ¿t righteous and moÅ¿t for common good (having an unlimited power fixed in them during life or pleaÅ¿ure) in time may become corrupt, or Å¿ettle into parties or Factions; or on the other Å¿ide, in the caÅ¿e of new Elections, thoÅ¿e that Å¿hould Å¿o Å¿ucceed may prove as bad or worÅ¿e then the former: We therefore humbly conceive, That (of two inconveniences the leÅ¿s being to be choÅ¿en) the main things to be intended in this caÅ¿e (and beyond which humane providence cannot reach, as to any aÅ¿Å¿urance of poÅ¿itive good) Å¿eems to be this; <hi>viz.</hi> To provide, that however unjuÅ¿t or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the perÅ¿ons of Parliament-men in preÅ¿ent or future may prove, or whatever ill they may do to particular parties, or to the whole in particular things, during their reÅ¿pective terms or periods, yet they Å¿hall not have the temptation or advantage of an unlimited power fixt in them during their own pleaÅ¿ures, whereby to perpetuate InjuÅ¿tice and OppreÅ¿Å¿ion upon any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end or remedy, or to advance and uphold any one particular

This we Å¿peak as in relation to the HouÅ¿e of Commons, as being intruÅ¿ted on the peoples behalf for their intereÅ¿t in that great and Supreme power of the Commonwealth, (<hi>viz.</hi> The LegiÅ¿lative power, with the power of final Judgement) which being in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Å¿o Arbitrary, and in a maner unlimited (unleÅ¿s in point of time) is moÅ¿t unfit and dangerous, as to the peoples intereÅ¿t, to be fixt in the perÅ¿ons of the Å¿ame men during life or their own pleaÅ¿ure; neither by the original conÅ¿titution of this State was it or ought it to continue Å¿o, nor do's it where ever it is and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Å¿o, render that State any better then a meer Tyranny, or the people Å¿ubjected to it any better then VaÅ¿Å¿als; but in all States where there is any face of common Freedom, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in this State of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> as is moÅ¿t evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent both by many PoÅ¿itive Laws (and Ancient conÅ¿tant Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿toms) the People have a Right to new and Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ive Elections unto that great and Supreme TruÅ¿t, at certain periods of time, which is Å¿o EÅ¿Å¿ential and Fundamental to their Freedom, as it cannot or ought not to be denied them or withheld from them, and without which the HouÅ¿e of Commons is of very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the IntereÅ¿t of the Commons of <hi>England:</hi> Yet in this we would not be miÅ¿underÅ¿tood, in the leaÅ¿t to blame thoÅ¿e Worthies of both HouÅ¿es, whoÅ¿e zeal to vindicate the Liberties of this Nation, did procure that Act for continuance of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, whereby it was Å¿ecured from being diÅ¿Å¿olved at the Kings pleaÅ¿ure, as former Parliaments have been, and reduced to Å¿uch a certainty as might enable them the better to aÅ¿Å¿ert and vindicate the Liberties of this Nation, immediately before Å¿o highly invaded, and then alÅ¿o Å¿o much indangered; and theÅ¿e we take to be the principal ends and grounds for which in that exigency of time and affairs it was promiÅ¿ed, and to which we acknowledge it hath happily been made uÅ¿e of: But we cannot
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57841:8"/>
think it was by thoÅ¿e Worthies intended, or ought to be made uÅ¿e of, to the perpetuating of that Supreme TruÅ¿t and Power in the perÅ¿ons of any during their own pleaÅ¿ures, or to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring of the People from their right of Elections totally new, when thoÅ¿e Dangers or Exigencies were paÅ¿t, and the Affairs and Safety of the Common-wealth would admit of Å¿uch a change.</p>
            <p>Having thus cleared our Grounds and Intentions, as we hope, from all Å¿cruples or miÅ¿underÅ¿tandings; in what follows we Å¿hall proceed further to propoÅ¿e, what we humbly deÅ¿ire for the Å¿etling and Å¿ecuring of our own and the Kingdoms Rights and Liberties (through the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of God to PoÅ¿terity) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon all the grounds premiÅ¿ed, we further humbly deÅ¿ire as followeth:</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Å¿ome determinate period of time may be Å¿et, for the continuance of this and future Parliaments, beyond which none Å¿hall continue, and upon which new Writs may of courÅ¿e iÅ¿Å¿ue out, and new Elections Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively take place, according to the intent of the Bill for Triennial Parliaments.</p>
            <p>And herein we would not be miÅ¿underÅ¿tood, to deÅ¿ire a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent or Å¿udden diÅ¿Å¿olution of this Parliament, but onely (as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ed before) That Å¿ome certain period may be Å¿et for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of it, Å¿o as it may not remain (as now) continuaile for ever, or during the pleaÅ¿ure of the preÅ¿ent Members: And we Å¿hould deÅ¿ire, That the period to be now Å¿et for ending this Parliament, may be Å¿uch as may give Å¿ufficient time for proviÅ¿ion of what is wanting, and neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be paÅ¿Å¿ed in point of JuÅ¿t Reformation, and for further Å¿ecuring the Rights, Liberties, and Å¿etling the Peace of the Kingdom; In order to which we further humbly offer:</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Å¿ecure proviÅ¿ion may be made for the continuance of future Perliaments, Å¿o as they may not be adjournable or diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olvable at the Kings pleaÅ¿ure, or any other ways, then by their own conÅ¿ent, during their reÅ¿pective periods, but at thoÅ¿e periods each Parliament to determine of courÅ¿e, as before: This we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire may be now provided for (if it may be) Å¿o as to put it out of all diÅ¿pute for future, though we think of right it ought not to have been otherwiÅ¿e before.</p>

            <p>More particularly under this Head we cannot but deÅ¿ire, That all Å¿uch as are impriÅ¿oned for any pretended MiÅ¿demeanor, may be put into a Å¿peedy way for a juÅ¿t Hearing and Tryal, and Å¿uch as Å¿hall appear to have been unjuÅ¿tly and unduly impriÅ¿oned, may (with their liberties) have Å¿ome reaÅ¿onable reparation, according to their Å¿ufferings, and the demerit of their oppreÅ¿Å¿ors.</p>
